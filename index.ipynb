    "The head of medical Board has tasked me to create a predictive model that can predict whether a patient has diabetes or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the question, I will build a classifier to predict whether patients have cancer with the given dataset.This will be based on several diagnostic measurements, including glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age. I will train models such as logistic regression, K Nearest Neighbours, decision trees and ensemble methods such as random forests and evaluate which model performs better."
